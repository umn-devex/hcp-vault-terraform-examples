## NOTICE

A corresponding policy will be created in this module for you in the `policy_templates` folder. Please update this file as necessary to access the correct secrets that are required.

## Applying Policies with the CLI

1. The policy within this module can also be created in Vault via the CLI using the command `vault policy write kvv2-example-policy kvv2.hcl`. 
    1. Please make sure to change the extension of the policy template files from `.tpl` to `.hcl` before running the command above
2. Once the policy has been created within the vault namespace, they can be assigned to groups using the command: `vault write identity/group/name/<group_name> policies="kvv2-example-policy"`

Please view this [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/policies/policies) to follow a tutorial on the use of policies. Documentation of policies as a concept can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/policies)
